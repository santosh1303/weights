# Weights
This is a sandbox like repository. To be used for Weights project. 

Idea is to:
  - Install NodeJS
  - Install Atom
  - Install MongoDB shell
  - Create a MongoDB Atlas Cluster in AWS. (https://cloud.mongodb.com/v2/5fb5858a152aec4a03a1900e#clusters/detail/ACOE)
  - Version control the ReactJS application source code here in GiHub repository.
  - Trigger build from Jenkins
  - Build it in a slave machine
  - Run unit tests
  - Deploy the application in an AWS instance
  - Run automated functional API tests in a slave machine
  - Run automated functional UI tests in a slave machine
  - Run automated performance tests in a slave machine
  - Run automated accessibility tests in a slave machine
  - Publish results
